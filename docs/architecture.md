# System Architecture

How the pieces of CampusTour DT-AMR fit together. This file covers what
crosses a folder boundary. Anything internal to one folder is documented
inside that folder.

`???` marks cross-deploy-unit contracts that are not fixed yet. The assistant
box is deliberately outside `robot/`; Section 5 defines the ownership boundary.

## 2. Robot subsystem (settled)

Sensor hierarchy — this is a decision, see
[ADR-0001](decisions/0001-lidar-primary-astra-supplementary.md):

```
RPLiDAR A3M1        -> /scan                 -> local + global costmap, AMCL, SLAM
encoder + IMU       -> /odom                 -> odom -> base_link TF
Astra Pro (depth)   -> /camera/depth/points  -> LOCAL costmap ONLY
Astra Pro (RGB)     -> person detection      -> Nav2 speed limit
                       (`robot_perception`, not the AI tour guide)
```

The STM32G431 owns real-time stepping. ROS 2 sends wheel-speed commands over
USB CDC serial and does not reach below that line.

Named-stop navigation is exposed as a ROS 2 action: `go_to_stop`
(`bus_manager` / `bus_interfaces`). This is the natural seam for the backend
to command a tour.

### 2.1 Robot identity and ROS namespace

The canonical robot ID format is `robot_NN`, starting with `robot_01`. The
same value is used by the backend/twin identity field, `BusStatus.bus_id`, and
the ROS namespace. Do not introduce parallel names such as `bus1`, `amr1`, or
`robot1` for the same vehicle.

Robot-owned ROS topics, actions, and services use relative names. With no
namespace they retain the original single-robot names such as `/cmd_vel`; with
`robot_id:=robot_01` the same interface resolves below `/robot_01`:

| Relative interface | Namespaced example |
|---|---|
| `cmd_vel`, `cmd_vel_manual`, `cmd_vel_nav` | `/robot_01/cmd_vel`, `/robot_01/cmd_vel_manual`, `/robot_01/cmd_vel_nav` |
| `odom`, `scan` | `/robot_01/odom`, `/robot_01/scan` |
| `robot_mode`, `robot_mode_state` | `/robot_01/robot_mode`, `/robot_01/robot_mode_state` |
| `emergency_stop`, `emergency_stop_state` | `/robot_01/emergency_stop`, `/robot_01/emergency_stop_state` |
| `go_to_stop`, `bus_status` | `/robot_01/go_to_stop`, `/robot_01/bus_status` |

The global campus frame remains `map`. Per-robot frames must use the canonical
ID as a prefix when multi-robot TF is implemented:

```text
map -> robot_01/odom -> robot_01/base_footprint -> robot_01/base_link
map -> robot_02/odom -> robot_02/base_footprint -> robot_02/base_link
```

This milestone namespaces the ROS interfaces and supports one namespaced real
robot or one namespaced simulated robot. It deliberately does not implement
multi-entity Gazebo or prefixed TF frames yet. Until both are implemented and
hardware-tested, do not run multiple robot stacks in one ROS domain: topic
isolation alone is not enough to prevent TF and Gazebo controller collisions.

## 3. Robot <-> Backend contract

> **SHAPE DECIDED, SCHEMA NOT.** The bridge topology below is fixed. The wire
> protocol and the message schema are still open — until they are filled in,
> neither side should hardcode a field name.

The backend does **not** speak ROS. A thin bridge node inside `robot/`
translates between ROS 2 and the backend API:

```
backend/ (.NET)  <-- REST | gRPC (TBD) -->  robot/ .../fleet_bridge  <-- ROS 2 -->  robot stack
```

Settled properties of that bridge:

- **It lives in `robot/`** (WP3 owns it) as a thin ROS 2 package, ships in the
  robot's existing Docker image, and runs one instance per miniPC. It is not a
  separate deploy unit and does not live in `backend/` or `digital-twin/`.
- **It carries both directions**: telemetry robot -> backend, and commands
  backend -> robot.
- **It is a translator only.** No booking rules, no scheduling, no robot
  assignment, no persistence. Those belong to `backend/` — the assignment
  algorithm is a `CampusTour.Application` service (`backend/AGENTS.md` §3).
  A bridge that starts deciding *which* robot does *what* is a design error.
- **Commands land on existing ROS interfaces.** A tour command becomes the
  `go_to_stop` action from Section 2 — the bridge does not invent a parallel
  ad-hoc command topic, and does not publish `/cmd_vel` itself.
- **The connection is outbound from the robot** where possible, so a miniPC on
  campus wifi behind NAT does not need an inbound route.

<!-- TODO(WP2 + WP3): chốt và điền phần còn lại:

Wire protocol:    REST | gRPC   (chưa chốt — chốt xong ghi vào đây và ADR)
Auth:             robot control channel phải authenticated (yêu cầu NFR bảo mật).
                  Chưa chốt dùng lại JWT của backend hay credential riêng cho robot.

Telemetry robot đẩy lên (tối thiểu):
  robot_id, pose (x, y, theta, frame), battery %, task state,
  current/next stop, fault code, timestamp
  tần suất: ? Hz

Lệnh backend đẩy xuống:
  assign_tour(robot_id, route_id, stops[], start_time)
  cancel_tour(robot_id)
  ...

Đổi bất kỳ field nào ở trên = contract change: sửa file này trong cùng PR.

## 4. Digital Twin

`robot/ros2_ws/src/simulation/` and `digital-twin/` have different purposes:

| Concern | Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Robot simulation | `robot/ros2_ws/src/simulation/` | Minimal Gazebo worlds and launches for developing/testing the robot stack without hardware |
| Digital Twin | `digital-twin/` | Live state synchronization, scenario orchestration, replay and repeatable latency/accuracy experiments |

The Digital Twin runs on a simulation workstation/server, never on the robot
miniPC. It must not duplicate the authoritative robot model, navigation logic
or ROS interfaces from `robot/`, and a scenario result must not directly
command a physical robot. Applying a validated route or schedule goes through
the authenticated backend/operator workflow.

> **INTERFACE NOT DECIDED YET.** WP2 and WP3 must define the synchronization
> transport, telemetry schema, timestamp/clock policy, update rate and replay
> format here before implementing the bridge. The experiment runner must record
> enough configuration and timing data for latency/accuracy results to be
> reproduced.

---

## 5. AI tour-guide assistant

`robot_perception` and the AI tour-guide assistant are separate systems with
different owners and safety boundaries:

| Concern | Owner | Runs on | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Person perception | WP3, `robot/ros2_ws/src/robot_perception/` | robot miniPC | RGB-D person detection and Nav2 speed limiting |
| AI tour guide | WP4, `ai-assistant/` | server/cloud | multilingual STT, campus knowledge/dialogue and TTS |

`robot_perception` does not answer visitor questions, generate narration or
own campus content. The AI tour guide does not publish `/cmd_vel`, set Nav2
goals, alter `/speed_limit`, or make any movement/safety decision.

A future thin robot-side adapter may listen for stop/task events, capture or
forward visitor audio, play returned speech and use cached narration when the
assistant is unavailable. That adapter belongs in `robot/`; STT, retrieval,
LLM/dialogue and TTS orchestration belong in `ai-assistant/`.

> **INTERFACE NOT DECIDED YET.** Before either side implements the integration,
> WP3 and WP4 must define the event/audio transport, schemas, authentication,
> timeouts and offline fallback here. Until then, neither side should hardcode
> cross-boundary field names.

## 6. Deployment

| Unit | Built by | Deployed how | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `robot/` ROS 2 | GitHub Actions -> DockerHub | `docker compose pull && up -d` | robot miniPC |
| `robot/` firmware | GitHub Actions (compile only) | manual ST-Link flash | STM32G431 |
| `digital-twin/` | <!-- TODO(WP3) --> | service/container | simulation workstation/server |
| `backend/` | <!-- TODO(WP2) --> | <!-- TODO(WP2): docker image? dotnet publish? --> | AWS EC2 |
| `ai-assistant/` | <!-- TODO(WP4) --> | service/container | server/cloud, not robot miniPC |
| `web/` | Vercel (git integration) | auto-deploy on push | Vercel, one project |

CI never flashes the STM32 and the miniPC never auto-flashes it — see
[ADR-0002](decisions/0002-manual-stlink-flash-no-can-bootloader.md).
