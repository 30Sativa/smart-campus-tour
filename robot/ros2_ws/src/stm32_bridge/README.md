# stm32_bridge

ROS2 Humble bridge for the real STM32 motor controller.

Flow:

```text
teleop_twist_keyboard / Nav2
        -> /cmd_vel
        -> stm32_bridge_node
        -> USB CDC Serial
        -> STM32
        -> HBS57H STEP/DIR
        -> motors

STM32
        -> FB feedback
        -> stm32_bridge_node
        +-> /wheel/odom (STEP-count wheel odometry)
        +-> /imu/data   (BNO085 Rotation Vector yaw)
                -> robot_localization EKF
                -> /odom + TF odom -> base_footprint
```

The laptop sends wheel speed commands and publishes separate wheel and IMU
measurements from STM32 feedback. The STM32 firmware keeps ownership of
real-time STEP/DIR generation; the EKF in the real-robot launch owns the fused
state and odometry TF.

## STM32 Protocol

The current firmware parses these command formats:

```text
CMD,<seq>,<left_mm_s>,<right_mm_s>\r\n
STOP,<seq>\r\n
```

Examples:

```text
CMD,0,300,300
CMD,1,-300,-300
CMD,2,-300,300
STOP,3
```

The bridge sends `CMD,...` for normal non-zero motion and the firmware's
dedicated `STOP,<seq>` for zero Twist commands, watchdog timeout, idle before
the first `/cmd_vel`, feedback timeout safety, and shutdown. Speed units are
`mm/s`, not step/s.

The current firmware sends feedback in this format:

```text
FB,<seq>,<left_count>,<right_count>,<dt_ms>,<status>\r\n
```

With IMU and the four SR04T sensors enabled, the firmware appends these fields:

```text
FB,<seq>,<left_count>,<right_count>,<dt_ms>,<status>,<yaw_cdeg>,<yaw_valid>,<sonar1_mm>,<sonar1_valid>,<sonar2_mm>,<sonar2_valid>,<sonar3_mm>,<sonar3_valid>,<sonar4_mm>,<sonar4_valid>\r\n
```

`sonar*_valid=0` means no valid echo was received; the bridge publishes NaN for
that `sensor_msgs/msg/Range` sample. The schematic mapping is `SONAR1 PB0/PB1`,
`SONAR2 PB11/PB12`, `SONAR3 PB13/PB14`, and `SONAR4 PB15/PA6` (echo on GPIOA
for SONAR4 only), with connector pin 2 as TRIG and pin 3 as ECHO (SONAR4's
TRIG is on connector pin 1 per the schematic).

Example:

```text
FB,42,1200,1195,20,OK
FB,43,1250,1243,20,OK
FB,44,1250,1243,20,STOP
```

Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `seq` | Last valid command sequence observed by the STM32 |
| `left_count` | Cumulative signed left step count |
| `right_count` | Cumulative signed right step count |
| `dt_ms` | Firmware feedback period in milliseconds |
| `status` | `OK`, `STOP`, `TIMEOUT`, or `ERR` |

The bridge also accepts the simpler fallback format
`FB,<left_count>,<right_count>,<dt_ms>,<status>` if firmware is changed later.

## Odometry

The node converts count deltas to differential-drive odometry:

```text
wheel_circumference = 2 * pi * wheel_radius
steps_per_meter = steps_per_rev * microstep * gear_ratio / wheel_circumference

left_distance = delta_left_count / steps_per_meter
right_distance = delta_right_count / steps_per_meter

delta_s = (right_distance + left_distance) / 2
delta_theta = (right_distance - left_distance) / wheel_base
```

Wheel pose and twist are integrated only from STEP counts; BNO085 yaw never
overrides this pose inside the bridge. The bridge publishes:

| Topic | Type |
|---|---|
| `/wheel/odom` | `nav_msgs/msg/Odometry` |
| `/imu/data` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Imu` (orientation only) |
| `/ultrasonic/sonar1/range` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Range` |
| `/ultrasonic/sonar2/range` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Range` |
| `/ultrasonic/sonar3/range` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Range` |
| `/ultrasonic/sonar4/range` | `sensor_msgs/msg/Range` |

For standalone debugging, `publish_tf:=true` broadcasts the wheel-only pose:

```text
odom -> base_footprint
```

The real `robot_control/manual_mode.launch.py` always passes
`publish_tf:=false` and starts `robot_localization`. That EKF fuses
`wheel/odom` twist `linear.x`, the diff-drive constraint `linear.y=0`, and
`angular.z` with `imu/data` orientation yaw, publishes final `odom`, and is the
only `odom -> base_footprint` TF owner. Repeated cached IMU measurements with
the same `(yaw, yaw_acc)` are not republished. A wheel sample without a valid
delta or time interval is dropped instead of publishing a fake zero twist.
`imu0_relative: true` makes the first BNO085 yaw the relative odom reference,
so startup does not snap to magnetic north. SLAM or AMCL remains responsible
for `map -> odom`.

Default drivetrain values match the current firmware notes:

```text
wheel_radius = 0.09725 m     # = 194.5 mm wheel diameter / 2; matched to URDF
steps_per_rev = 200          # 57EBP98ALC, 1.8 deg/step
microstep = 8                # 200 * 8 = 1600 = HBS57H driver pulse/rev
gear_ratio = 10              # F57-L1-10-P2 planetary gearbox
steps_per_meter ~= 26185     # 1600 * 10 / (pi * 0.1945)
```

These match the physical constants compiled into the firmware
(`robot/firmware/stm32/motor_controller/Core/Inc/motor/motor.h`:
`DRIVER_PULSE_PER_REV=1600`, `GEAR_RATIO=10`,
`WHEEL_DIAMETER_MM=194.5`). If you change a DIP switch or the gearbox, update both
the firmware header and these parameters.

## Environment

When running inside Ubuntu 22.04 on VMware:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyACM*
dmesg | grep tty
```

If `/dev/ttyACM0` does not appear, connect the STM32 USB device to the VM from
VMware Removable Devices first.

Give your user serial permission:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

Then log out and log back in.

## Build

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select stm32_bridge
source install/setup.bash
```

## Run Bridge

```bash
ros2 launch stm32_bridge stm32_bridge.launch.py
```

If the STM32 appears on a different port:

```bash
ros2 launch stm32_bridge stm32_bridge.launch.py port:=/dev/ttyACM1
```

Useful tuning examples:

```bash
ros2 launch stm32_bridge stm32_bridge.launch.py speed_scale:=0.2
ros2 launch stm32_bridge stm32_bridge.launch.py max_wheel_speed_mm_s:=150
ros2 launch stm32_bridge stm32_bridge.launch.py invert_left:=false invert_right:=false
ros2 launch stm32_bridge stm32_bridge.launch.py publish_odom:=true publish_tf:=true
```

The real-robot defaults keep the peak wheel speed limit at `250 mm/s`; lower
`speed_scale` values remain available for bench/debug work. For the installed
drivetrain, both command signs are inverted so `i` (ROS `linear.x > 0`) drives
physically forward. Override both `invert_*` arguments together only after
verifying the motor direction on a raised-wheel bench test. `teleop_twist_keyboard`
usually sends `0.5 m/s` when pressing `i`; with `speed_scale=1.0`, the bridge
passes the command through before the `250 mm/s` pair-scaling limit. The `1600`
value in firmware is the HBS57H driver resolution in pulses per motor
revolution, not a wheel speed.

## Run Teleop

In another terminal:

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

## Check Measurements

```bash
ros2 topic echo /wheel/odom
ros2 topic echo /imu/data
```

Use a `robot_control` real launch to also check the EKF output on `/odom`.

## Check TF

```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo odom base_link
```

Or generate a frame graph:

```bash
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
```

## If `/wheel/odom` Does Not Change

1. Confirm the STM32 is sending lines like `FB,42,1200,1195,20,OK`.
2. Use a serial monitor or `tools/motor_serial_debug.ps1` from this repo to
   inspect raw feedback.
3. Check that `feedback_counts_are_cumulative` matches the firmware.
4. Check drivetrain parameters: `wheel_radius`, `steps_per_rev`, `microstep`,
   and `gear_ratio`.
5. If the pose runs in the wrong direction (e.g. driving forward decreases `x`),
   the **count** sign is reversed. Fix odometry only with
   `odom_invert_left:=true` / `odom_invert_right:=true`. Do **not** use
   `invert_left/right` for this — those flip the motor command, not odometry.

## Test Checklist

- Forward key produces `linear.x > 0`; with the installed drivetrain
  correction the bridge sends `CMD,<seq>,negative,negative`.
- Backward key produces `linear.x < 0`; the bridge sends positive wheel values.
- Rotate key sends opposite signs on left and right.
- If forward motion moves one wheel only, test each driver path with
  `tools/motor_test_one_wheel.ps1` and compare the left/right counts in `FB`.
- Releasing keys or losing `/cmd_vel` for `cmd_timeout` sends `STOP,<seq>`.
- Incoming `FB,...` lines update `/wheel/odom` and valid yaw updates `/imu/data`.
- In the real stack, `/odom` updates and `tf2_echo odom base_link` is live from
  the EKF; the bridge must not publish that TF.
- Serial disconnect/reconnect does not crash the node.
- If one wheel spins the wrong way, set `invert_left`/`invert_right` (command).
  If the pose integrates the wrong way, set `odom_invert_left`/`odom_invert_right`
  (odometry). These are independent.
- If the robot is too slow after bench testing, increase `speed_scale`, increase
  `max_wheel_speed_mm_s`, or increase the teleop speed.

## Assumptions and Limitations

Read these before trusting wheel or fused odometry on the real robot.

- **ROS receives STEP count, not measured encoder position.** The HBS57H uses
  its motor encoder internally to prevent lost steps, but it does not return
  encoder position to the STM32 or ROS. Firmware increments the feedback count
  once per generated STEP pulse (`count += direction`). Wheel slip can therefore
  still make both wheel and fused odometry drift. The BNO085 yaw stabilizes
  heading; SLAM/AMCL supplies environment-based global pose correction.

- **`dt_ms` is "time since last successfully-sent feedback", not a fixed period.**
  In firmware, `dt_ms = now - last_feedback_sent_ms`. If a USB CDC frame is
  dropped, the next delivered frame reports a larger `dt_ms` that still matches
  the true gap the bridge observed, so `velocity = delta_s / dt` stays correct.
  The downside: if the firmware is ever changed to emit a *fixed* period while
  packets are still being dropped, the reported velocity would become wrong. The
  bridge already falls back to ROS-clock dt when `dt_ms <= 0`.

- **Command invert vs. odometry invert are separate.** `invert_left/right` flip
  only the motor command. The firmware STEP feedback follows the command
  direction after command inversion, but hardware tests on the current
  drivetrain show that physical forward and CCW motion produce raw STEP-based
  odometry signs opposite to the ROS convention. Use `odom_invert_left/right`
  to correct feedback for odometry only; they do not change motor direction.
  The standalone bridge launch can remain at its `false/false` defaults, while
  the production real stack (`robot_control/manual_mode.launch.py`) overrides
  both to `true/true`. If wiring or command-direction configuration changes,
  hardware-test the count sign again instead of assuming the current correction
  remains valid.

- **`reset_odom_on_start` zeroes the count baseline, not the pose.** Pose
  (`x/y/theta`) always starts at 0 on node startup; the first cumulative feedback
  sample is consumed as the baseline so the initial jump is not integrated.
