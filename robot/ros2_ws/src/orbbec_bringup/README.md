# orbbec_bringup — Orbbec Astra Pro (Phase 1)

This package owns the robot-specific half of the depth camera: a launch entry
point with sane parameters, the `base_link -> camera_link` mount transform, an
RViz layout for verification, and the host setup/verify scripts.  The vendor
driver stays untouched in `ros2_ws/src/third_party/`.

## 1. What the Astra Pro actually is

The Astra Pro is **two USB devices in one plastic shell**:

| Half | Protocol | USB id | Driven by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Depth + IR | OpenNI2 | `2bc5:0403` | `astra_camera_node` via the bundled OpenNI2 redist |
| RGB | plain UVC webcam | `2bc5:0501` (`0502` on FHD units) | `astra_camera_node` via libuvc |

Three consequences that shape everything below:

- The driver is Orbbec's **legacy** [`ros2_astra_camera`](https://github.com/orbbec/ros2_astra_camera).
  `OrbbecSDK_ROS2` is for Astra 2 / Gemini / Femto and does **not** cover this camera.
- `use_uvc_camera` must be `true` and `uvc_product_id` must match `lsusb`, or
  depth works and RGB is silently missing.
- **Hardware depth-to-color registration does not exist on this camera.**  The
  colour sensor is not visible to OpenNI2, so there is nothing to align against
  in hardware.  `depth_registration` and `enable_colored_point_cloud` stay
  `false`; an aligned/coloured cloud is a Phase 2 problem solved by calibrating
  both cameras and running `depth_image_proc::RegisterNode`.

The OpenNI2 redistributable (`x64`, `arm`, `arm64`) ships **inside** the driver
repository under `astra_camera/openni2_redist`.  There is no separate
`openNISDK_ROS2_*.tar.gz` to download.

## 2. One-time host setup

On the deployed miniPC, native execution is a camera-only hardware exception:
the Astra USB dependencies and this camera driver run on the host. Drivetrain,
navigation, and the main ROS runtime remain in the Docker image. Build only the
camera package and its dependencies for the native overlay; do not build the
full workspace on the naked miniPC or run duplicate STM32, Nav2, or
`robot_control` nodes there. Development machines may use the workspace build
flow below for broader testing.

udev rules and libuvc belong to the machine holding the USB cable — the Ubuntu
VM now, the miniPC later.  A Docker image cannot supply them for you.

```bash
bash ros2_ws/src/orbbec_bringup/scripts/setup_astra_pro.sh
```

It installs the apt dependencies, builds libuvc from source, clones the vendor
driver into `ros2_ws/src/third_party/ros2_astra_camera`, installs
`56-orbbec-usb.rules`, and prints what the kernel currently sees.

**Unplug and replug the camera after this step** — udev rules do not apply
retroactively to an already-enumerated device.

Then build. On the deployed miniPC, select the camera package and its
dependencies:

```bash
cd ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to orbbec_bringup \
  --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source install/setup.bash
```

## 3. Running

```bash
ros2 launch orbbec_bringup orbbec_with_mount.launch.py \
  x:=0.25 y:=0.0 z:=0.35 \
  rviz:=true
```

`x/y/z/roll/pitch/yaw` are the **measured** offset from `base_link` to the
camera body, in metres and radians, ROS convention (x forward, y left, z up).
Measure them; do not leave the zeros.

FHD variant (check `lsusb -d 2bc5:` first):

```bash
ros2 launch orbbec_bringup orbbec_with_mount.launch.py uvc_product_id:=0x0502
```

Driver only, no mount TF:

```bash
ros2 launch orbbec_bringup astra_pro.launch.py
```

### Parameter defaults chosen here and why

| Parameter | Vendor default | Ours | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enable_ir` | `true` | `false` | Depth and IR share one sensor; requesting both is the most common cause of a driver that opens and then stalls |
| `depth_registration` | `false` | `false` | Not supported on this camera — kept explicit so nobody "fixes" it |
| `enable_colored_point_cloud` | `false` | `false` | Requires the above |
| `uvc_product_id` | `0x0501` | `0x0501` | Override to `0x0502` on FHD units |

## 4. Phase 1 acceptance

With the launch running, in a second terminal:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
bash ros2_ws/src/orbbec_bringup/scripts/verify_astra_pro.sh
```

Phase 1 is done when every check passes **and holds for 60 seconds** — a driver
that streams for five seconds and dies is the normal Astra Pro failure mode, so
a snapshot check is not enough.

Expected interface:

```
/camera/color/image_raw        sensor_msgs/Image        ~30 Hz
/camera/color/camera_info      sensor_msgs/CameraInfo
/camera/depth/image_raw        sensor_msgs/Image        ~30 Hz  (16UC1, mm)
/camera/depth/camera_info      sensor_msgs/CameraInfo
/camera/depth/points           sensor_msgs/PointCloud2
/camera/ir/image_raw           (only when enable_ir:=true)
```

TF published by the driver, under `camera_link`:

```
camera_link
├── camera_depth_frame  → camera_depth_optical_frame
└── camera_color_frame  → camera_color_optical_frame
```

and `base_link -> camera_link` from `camera_mount.launch.py`.

Note: the driver publishes `camera_color_frame` with two parents
(`camera_link` and `camera_depth_frame`).  That is a quirk of the vendor code,
not a bug in this package, and it does not block Phase 1 — but it is why you
should read the tree with `ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames` rather than trusting
it by eye.

## 5. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `lsusb -d 2bc5:` shows nothing | VM did not claim the device / cable is charge-only | Connect **both** Astra entries to the guest; use a data cable |
| Only `2bc5:0403` shows | The UVC half went to the host, or to a different VM device slot | Attach the second entry too |
| Depth streams, RGB never appears | Wrong `uvc_product_id` | `ros2 launch ... uvc_product_id:=0x0502` |
| `Permission denied` / `uvc_open failed` | udev rules not applied | Re-run `install.sh`, `udevadm trigger`, then **replug** |
| `libuvc is not found` at build time | libuvc not installed or not on the pkg-config path | Re-run `setup_astra_pro.sh`, then `sudo ldconfig` |
| Driver starts then hangs after a few frames | USB bandwidth, or IR enabled with depth | `enable_ir:=false`; drop to `depth_fps:=15`; give the VM a USB 3.x controller |
| Topics list but RViz shows nothing | QoS mismatch | `ros2 topic info -v /camera/depth/points`; set RViz reliability to match |
| RViz2 crashes / black 3D view in the VM | No GPU passthrough | `export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` before `rviz2` |
| `color/camera_info` looks wrong | It is the factory guess, not this unit | Calibrate with `camera_calibration`, pass `color_info_url:=file:///...` |

## 6. Not in Phase 1, deliberately

Docker packaging, depth→laserscan, Nav2 integration, RGB intrinsic
calibration, and depth-to-colour alignment are all Phase 2+. The main
`docker-compose.yml` forwards the STM32 serial device and RPLiDAR device; the
Astra Pro stays on the host as the camera-only hardware exception above. This
does not change camera TF, USB mapping, or calibration.
