# AGENTS.md — `robot/`

Robot-side software for CampusTour DT-AMR: ROS 2 Humble on the miniPC plus
STM32G431 motor firmware. Read the repo-root `AGENTS.md` first for the shared
rules; this file only covers what is specific to `robot/`.

└── docker-compose.yml    what the miniPC runs
```

Architecture, package roles, sensor dataflow and run commands: **`robot/README.md`**.
Serial contract between the STM32 firmware and `stm32_bridge`:
**`robot/docs/PROTOCOL_FB.md`** — single source of truth, read it before
touching either side of the wire.
Per-phase design, close-out criteria and error tables: **`robot/docs/phase*.md`**.

## 2. Architecture Rules

The sensor hierarchy is a deliberate decision, not an accident
(see `docs/decisions/0001-lidar-primary-astra-supplementary.md`):

```
RPLiDAR A3M1        -> /scan                  -> local + global costmap, AMCL, SLAM
encoder + IMU       -> /odom                  -> odom -> base_link TF
Astra Pro (depth)   -> /camera/depth/points   -> LOCAL costmap ONLY
Astra Pro (RGB)     -> person detection       -> Nav2 speed limit
```

- The Astra Pro is a **supplementary** obstacle sensor. Do not make it a
  localization input, do not feed it into the global costmap, do not make Nav2
  depend on it being present.
- The STM32 owns real-time stepping. ROS 2 sends wheel-speed commands over USB
  CDC serial and owns nothing below that line.
- `robot_control` is the mode manager / `cmd_vel` mux. New motion sources go
  through it, not directly onto `/cmd_vel`.
- `robot_perception` is WP3 person perception for navigation behaviour. It is
  not the WP4 AI tour-guide assistant and must not contain STT, LLM/dialogue,
  campus knowledge or TTS orchestration.
- A future robot-side tour-guide adapter stays thin: ROS stop/task events and
  audio I/O only. The conversational pipeline belongs in `ai-assistant/`; its
  cross-folder contract must be recorded in `docs/architecture.md` first.
- The **fleet bridge** to the backend lives here (planned:
  `robot/ros2_ws/src/fleet_bridge/`), not in `backend/`. It is a translator
  only — ROS 2 on one side, the backend's REST/gRPC API on the other. It must
  not contain booking rules, scheduling, or robot-assignment logic; those are
  backend concerns (`docs/architecture.md` §3). It sends commands through
  existing interfaces such as the `go_to_stop` action, never straight onto
  `/cmd_vel`.
- Launch files must keep RViz **off by default** (`rviz:=true` to enable) so a
  headless miniPC does not hang.
- Fast DDS Discovery Server can make CLI graph introspection (`ros2 topic list`,
  `ros2 node info`) temporarily incomplete even while topics carry data. Follow
  the troubleshooting note in `docs/network-ros-discovery.md` before declaring
  a node or endpoint unavailable.

## 3. Development Rules

- Python nodes follow the existing package layout: `package_name/package_name/`
  for source, `test/` for tests, `config/` for YAML params, `launch/` for
  launch files.
- Parameters go in `config/*.yaml`. Do not hardcode a value in a node that an
  existing config file already exposes.
- New topics/actions/messages that another work package consumes must be added
  to `bus_interfaces` and recorded in `docs/architecture.md`.
- Do not vendor third-party sources anywhere except
  `robot/ros2_ws/src/third_party/` (gitignored by design).
- Never edit anything under `build/`, `install/`, or `log/`.

---

## 4. Verification

```bash
robot/scripts/verify          # tier 1, plus tier 2 if a ROS 2 env is sourced
```

The gate has three tiers. **Only tiers 1 and 2 are automated.**

### Tier 1 — static (runs anywhere, no ROS needed)

- Python syntax compile across `robot/ros2_ws/src`
- `ruff` lint if installed
- YAML parse of every `config/` and `launch/` file
- `xacro` parse of the URDF if `xacro` is available
- guard: no `build/`, `install/`, `log/`, `__pycache__`, or firmware `Debug/`
  build output staged in git

### Tier 2 — build & test (needs a sourced ROS 2 Humble environment)

- `colcon build`
- `colcon test` + `colcon test-result --verbose`

Skipped with a clear SKIPPED notice when ROS 2 is not sourced. **A skipped
tier 2 is not a pass** — say so when reporting.

### Tier 3 — behaviour (a human runs this, an agent cannot)

Anything only observable in Gazebo, RViz, or on the real robot: navigation,
TF tree, costmap contribution, obstacle avoidance, motor response, serial
link. The close-out criteria for each are in `robot/docs/phase*.md`.

An agent changing navigation, TF, costmaps, serial, or firmware reports
**READY FOR HARDWARE TEST** (format in the root `AGENTS.md`), never DONE.

## 5. Hard Constraints — STM32 & Firmware

These exist because getting them wrong destroys hardware or wastes a lab day.

- **Do not change the STM32 serial protocol or motor-control logic** unless a
  task explicitly asks for it.
- **Do not edit `robot/firmware/stm32/motor_controller/Core/`, `Drivers/`, or
  `.ioc`-generated files by hand.** They are regenerated by STM32CubeIDE and
  hand edits are silently lost. Change the `.ioc` and regenerate instead.
- **Do not edit `robot/firmware/stm32/motor_controller/Debug/makefile`.** CI patches
  the Windows absolute linker-script path inside that file at build time; a
  hand edit breaks `.github/workflows/stm32-build.yml`.
- **Flashing is manual, over ST-Link, by a human.** CI must never flash. The
  miniPC must never auto-flash. There is no CAN bootloader and adding one is
  out of scope.
  See `docs/decisions/0002-manual-stlink-flash-no-can-bootloader.md`.
- **Do not change the serial defaults** `SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0`,
  `BAUDRATE=115200`, or `LIDAR_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0` — the miniPC `.env` and the
  compose file depend on them.
- The Docker build context is `robot/`. Paths inside `Dockerfile` are relative
  to `robot/`, not to the repo root.
- Deployment is image-based: build in CI, push to DockerHub, pull on the
  miniPC. Do not add a "git pull and colcon build on the robot" path.
  See `docs/decisions/0003-deploy-robot-via-docker-image.md`.
